How many gifts do I get after the Twelve Days of Christmas? Express this as a mathematical formula.

Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the longest palindromic substring within that string. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
For example:
Input: \"babad\" Output: \"bab\" or \"aba\" (both are valid)
Input: \"cbbd\" Output: \"bb\"
Input: \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\" Output: \"a man, a plan, a canal: panama\"
Your function should be case-insensitive and ignore non-alphanumeric characters when determining palindromes. The function should be efficient and able to handle strings of up to 1000 characters in length.
Provide your solution along with an explanation of your approach and its time complexity. Write a version that has lower time complexity than O(n^2).

You are a detective investigating a series of art thefts at the city's most prestigious museums. Over the past month, four paintings have been stolen from three different museums. Here are the facts you've gathered so far:
The thefts occurred on consecutive Fridays.
Each theft took place between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM.
The security cameras were disabled during each theft.
No signs of forced entry were found at any of the crime scenes.
The stolen paintings are: a) \"Sunset over the Lake\" from the Metropolitan Museum b) \"The Weeping Willow\" from the National Gallery c) \"Dancers in the Rain\" from the Modern Art Museum d) \"Moonlit Sonata\" also from the Modern Art Museum
Each painting was protected by a different security system: a) Laser grid b) Pressure-sensitive floor c) Infrared sensors d) Motion detectors
The museums employ different security companies:
Metropolitan Museum: SecureGuard
National Gallery: SafeKeep
Modern Art Museum: VigilantEye
All four paintings were insured by the same company: ArtSure Insurance.
Each museum reported that a staff member called in sick on the day of the theft.
The sick staff members were: a) A tour guide at the Metropolitan Museum b) A custodian at the National Gallery c) A security guard at the Modern Art Museum (for both thefts)
Trace evidence found at each scene included: a) Metropolitan Museum: A single black hair b) National Gallery: Traces of chalk dust c) Modern Art Museum (both thefts): Fibers from a blue uniform
Based on this information, you suspect that these thefts are connected and possibly an inside job. Your task is to analyze the evidence and identify potential suspects or patterns that could lead to solving the case.
Question: What logical conclusions can you draw from the given information, and what additional information would be most crucial to furthering the investigation?

Explain the quote \"I do desire we may be better strangers\"

You are a close-reading bot with a great memory who answers questions for users. I'm going to give you the text of an essay. Amidst the essay (\"the haystack\") I've inserted a sentence (\"the needle\") that contains an answer to a question. 
Here's the question: \"What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?\"
Here's the text of the essay. The answer appears in it somewhere: \"A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the biggest regrets of the dying.  Her list seems plausible.  I could see myself — can see myself — making at least 4 of these 5 mistakes. If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might be: don't be a cog.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops. The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission. The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in a park on a sunny day. You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy. Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of mistake, because you make them by default. I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  But how do you avoid mistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so it has other defaults.  But it may not be possible to do that completely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them.  So I inverted the 5 regrets, yielding a list of 5 commandsDon't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what youthink; cultivate friendships; be happy.which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.\"
Now that you've read the context, please answer the question, repeated one more time for reference: \"What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?\"
To do so, first find the sentence from the haystack that contains the answer (there is such a sentence, I promise!) and put it inside <most_relevant_sentence> XML tags. Then, put your answer in <answer> tags. Base your answer strictly on the context, without reference to outside information. Thank you. If you can't find the answer return the single word UNANSWERABLE.
